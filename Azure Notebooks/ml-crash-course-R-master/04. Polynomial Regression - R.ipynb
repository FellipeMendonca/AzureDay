We would expect satisfaction would be low if the fruit is under-ripe or over-ripe, and satisfaction would be high if fruit is ripe, i.e. between under-ripe and over-ripe.\n\nThis is not something linear regression will help us with, however polynomial regression can help us make predictions for more complex non-linear relationships such as these.\n\nStep 1\n---\n\nIn this exercise, we will look at a dataset analysing internet traffic over the course of the day. Observations were made every hour, on the hour, over the course of several days. Suppose we want to predict the level of internet traffic we might see at any time during the day, how might we do this?\n\nLet's start by loading the required libraries for this session, and loading our data to have a look at it.\n\n** In the cell below replace: **\n\n** 1. `<dataPreviewStr>` with `str` **\n\n** 2. `<dataPreviewHead>` with `head` **\n\n** then __run the code__. **"

The `ggplot2` functions expect our data input to be in \"long\" format, i.e. a column for each feature name, and a row for each observation. Currently, our data is stored in \"wide\" format, with one feature, i.e. the hour, spread across multiple columns.
