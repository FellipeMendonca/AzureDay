Neural networks can be used for both regression and categorisation applications. Recent advances with storage, processing power, and open-source tools have allowed many successful applications of neural networks in medical diagnosis, filtering explicit content, speech recognition, and machine translation.\n\nIn this exercise we will compare three dog breeds using their age, weight, and height. We will make a neural network model to classify the breeds of dogs based on these features.\n\nNote: It's extremely common for AI practitioners to use a template such as the one below for making neural networks quickly. After you are done, feel free to play around with the template to get a feel of how you can easily adjust a neural network to your problems using the package `keras`.\n\nLet's start by loading the libraries required for this session.\n\n**Run the code below**"
