There are some outliers, but for the most part, the features trunk girth and trunk height allow you to predict tree type.\n\nNow, say we obtain a new tree specimen and we want to figure out the tree type based on its leaf and trunk measurements. We *could* make a rough guess as to which tree type it belongs to based on where the tree data points lie in the two scatter plots we just created. Alternatively, using these same leaf and trunk measurements, SVMs can predict the tree type for us. SVMs will use the features and labels we provide for known tree types to create hyperplanes for tree type. These hyperplanes allow us to predict which tree type a new tree specimen belongs to, given their leaf and trunk measurements.\n\nIn the next step, we will use SVMs to help solve this problem.\n\nStep 2\n-----\n\nLet's make two SVMs using our data, `tree_data`: one SVM based on the leaf features, and another SVM based on the trunk features.\n\nThe syntax for a simple SVM using the package `e1071` is as follows:\n\n`svm_model <- svm(x = x, y = y, data = dataset)`\n\nwhere `x` represents the features (of class *matrix*), and `y` represents the labels (of class *factor*).\n\n> **R uses a variety of data types and data structures to describe different objects. You may have noticed a few types of objects already, including** `data.frame`, `list`, `matrix`, `factor`, **and** atomic vectors (`integer`, `numeric`, `logical`, `character`). **Knowing the structure of your data object is crucial, particularly when you are running functions that require the data object to be of a certain type.**\n\n> **For the `svm` function, we require two types of data structures: a** `matrix` **and a** `factor`**. A** `matrix` **is a two-dimensional data structure (with rows and columns) containing elements of all the same type, most commonly numbers (numeric or integer) with which you can perform further mathematical operations. Note that a** `matrix` **is different from a** `data.frame`**, as data frames can contain a mix of elements, i.e. both numbers (numeric/integer) and letters (factor/character/logical). A** `factor` **is used to categorize data, where the names of the categories are known as levels. For example, \"fruit\" could be a factor, with levels including \"apples\", \"bananas\", and \"oranges\", or in our example \"tree type\" can be a factor, with levels \"0\", \"1\", and \"2\". Also note that the levels of factors can be ordered, e.g. \"clothing size\" can be a factor, and you can order the levels \"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\", which is important when it comes to plotting the data.**\n\nFor our two SVMs, we will need to create the appropriate `x` and `y` variables based on `tree_data`.\n\nThe first SVM will be based on the leaf features `leaf_width` and `leaf_length`. We will need to create a new variable that contains only these two features, then convert it from a `data.frame` to a `matrix`, so it can be the input to the `x` argument in the `svm` function. We also need to convert the labels `tree_type` into a factor for the input to the `y` variable  of the `svm` function, as it is currently stored as an integer (see the results from `str` above, where `int` stands for `integer`).\n\nThe code below creates the appropriate `x` and `y` variables for the leaf features in `tree_data`. \n\n### In the cell below replace:\n#### 1. `<leafFeature1>` with `leaf_width`\n#### 2. `<leafFeature2>` with `leaf_length`\n#### then __run the code__."
