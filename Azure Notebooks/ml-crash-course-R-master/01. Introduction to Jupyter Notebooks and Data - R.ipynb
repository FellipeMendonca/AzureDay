Names such as \".2way\" are not valid, and neither are the reserved words_\n\nReserved words include: `if` `else` `repeat` `while` `function` `for` `in` `next` `break` `TRUE` `FALSE` `NULL` `Inf` `NaN` `NA` `NA_integer_` `NA_real_` `NA_complex_` `NA_character_` `...` `..1` `..2` `..3` (etc)\n\nBe mindful that variable names should help describe the information you are saving; you should aim for variable names that are descriptive."

We can use the money in different ways, for example, we may want to count how much money is in the box, take some money out of the box then deposit it in the bank, or add more money to the box.\n\nSimilarly, in R, when we save numbers inside a variable, we can perform various calculations to the numbers we store inside the variable. Above, we asked R to add a value of one to the number that we stored in the `my_first_number` variable. We also asked R to calculate the square root of our variable using the function `sqrt()`.\n\nN.B. Performing calculations on the `my_first_number` variable will not change the value it has stored.

The `sqrt` function only takes one argument.\n```\nsqrt(my_first_number)\n     ↑↑↑\n```\nIn the example above, we supplied the `sqrt()` function a variable name `my_first_number` between the brackets, and the result, i.e. the square root of `my_first_number`, is printed to the screen.               \n      \n\nStep 5\n---\n\nLet's make a graph from some data. First we need to load the appropriate library to create a graph. The first line of code below loads the `ggplot2` library that contains the functions for graphing capabilities in this exercise. At the start of (most) R programming exercises, we have to load **libraries** to help us perform tasks. \n\n** Click on the code below, then hit the `Run` button to create a scatter plot using the `ggplot2` library.
