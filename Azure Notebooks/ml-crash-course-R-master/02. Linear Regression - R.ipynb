We checked the structure of `choc_data`, and explored some of the variables we have about chocolate bars using graphs.\n\nIn this exercise, we want to know how to make our chocolate-bar customers happier. To do this, we need to know whether chocolate bar _features_ can predict customer happiness. For example, customers may be happier when chocolate bars are bigger, or when they contain more cocoa.\n\nWe have data on customer happiness when eating chocolate bars with different features. Let's explore the relationship between customer happiness and the different features we have available.\n\nStep 1\n---\n\nFirst, we need to load the required libraries and data we will use in this exercise.\n\nBelow, we'll also use the functions `str`, `head`, and `tail` to inspect the structure of `choc_data`.\n\n** In the cell below replace: **\n\n** 1. `<structureFunction>` with `str` **\n\n** 2. `<headFunction>` with `head` **\n\n** 3. `<tailFunction>` with `tail` **\n\n** then __run the code__. **"

It is possible to perform linear regression directly with `ggplot2` using the following function and arguments: `stat_smooth(method = \"lm\")`. However, we want to show you how to create linear models without the dependency of `ggplot2`.*\n\nConclusion\n---\nWell done! You have run a simple linear regression that revealed chocolate bars heavier in weight and with higher percentages of cocoa make customers happy.\n\nYou can now go back to the course and click __'Next Step'__ to move onto using linear regression with multiple features."
